            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Visibility of System Status</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience: </strong> While immediate feedback is provided, adding loading indicators during AJAX operations would enhance user awareness of ongoing processes.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Match Between System and the Real World</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The terminology is clear and logical, but ensuring consistent use throughout the interface will reinforce user understanding.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: User Control and Freedom</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Users can cancel actions by closing modals, but adding explicit Cancel buttons on forms would provide clearer options for users to backtrack.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The design maintains consistent UI patterns, which is positive. Continuing to uphold these standards will prevent user confusion.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Error Prevention</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The system effectively uses required fields and confirmation dialogs to prevent errors. Adding inline validation messages would further assist users in correcting input mistakes. </p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Clear labels and image previews are beneficial, but providing tooltips or help icons for complex fields would reduce cognitive load.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The absence of keyboard shortcuts limits efficiency. Implementing keyboard navigation and shortcuts would cater to both novice and expert users.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The clean UI is effective, but hiding rarely used options would further reduce clutter and enhance focus on essential tasks.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> While error messages are displayed in alert boxes, using inline error messages near fields would provide immediate context for users.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help and Documentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The lack of visible help or documentation links is a gap. Providing contextual help or documentation links would empower users to find assistance when needed.</p>
