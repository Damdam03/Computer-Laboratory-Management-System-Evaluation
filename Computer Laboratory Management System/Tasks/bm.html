            <h3>Heuristic Violated: User Control and Freedom</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The system lack features that allow users to go back a step in the process and do not support undo and redo actions. Adding these features would enhance user control and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong> Adding features that allow users to navigate backward and undo/redo actions would reduce user frustration and provide a sense of control, making the systems more flexible and accommodating to user needs.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> While important information is kept visible, this systems lack in-context help, which could assist users in understanding complex fields or tasks without requiring them to recall information from other parts of the interface.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong> Incorporating help within the context of the interface would minimize the user's memory load and provide immediate assistance, making the systems easier to use and reducing the learning curve for new users.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Although traditional error visuals are used, the systems do not offer immediate solutions to errors. Providing solutions like undo, redo, and error reports would improve error recovery.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong> Offering immediate solutions to errors, such as undo options and clear error reports, would help users quickly recover from mistakes and understand how to avoid similar errors in the future.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help and Documentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This systems lack documentation, which could help users understand how to complete their tasks and use the systems effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong> Providing easily accessible documentation would empower users to understand and utilize the systems' features fully, reducing confusion and the need for external support.</p>
