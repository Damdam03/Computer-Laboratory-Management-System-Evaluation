            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Visibility of System Status</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience: </strong> The design is simple and user-friendly, but replacing the generic "Action" label with clear terms like "Edit" and "Delete" would enhance clarity and reduce confusion.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Match Between System and the Real World</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The terminology and controls are familiar to users, but consistent use of specific labels like "Edit" and "Delete" instead of "Action" would improve clarity and avoid confusion.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: User Control and Freedom</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Returned items are unclickable, and adding visual indicators like color changes or icons, along with tooltips, would help users understand their read-only status.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The design is consistent and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the interface.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Error Prevention</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Improving button clarity and providing visual cues for inactive buttons, such as using specific labels like "Edit" and "Delete," would reduce errors.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The design is well-organized and accessible, allowing users to find information easily without needing to recall details from other parts of the interface.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Adding keyboard shortcuts and customization options would enhance efficiency and cater to both novice and experienced users.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> The design is clean and focused, but removing unnecessary elements would improve clarity and visual appeal.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Adding clear error messages with visual cues like red text or icons, and providing validation messages, would help users correct mistakes effectively.</p>

            <h3>Heuristic Violated: Help and Documentation</h3>
            <p><strong>Description and Impact on User Experience:</strong> Improving the search function with suggestions would make it more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
